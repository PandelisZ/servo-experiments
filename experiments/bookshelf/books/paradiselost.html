<h5 id="id00014">  BOOK I.</h5>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with no middle flight intends to soar<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the highth of this great Argument<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I may assert th' Eternal Providence,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And justifie the wayes of God to men.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00016">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From their Creator, and transgress his Will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who first seduc'd them to that fowl revolt?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To set himself in Glory above his Peers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He trusted to have equal'd the most High,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Throne and Monarchy of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With hideous ruine and combustion down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That witness'd huge affliction and dismay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;No light, but rather darkness visible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes to all; but torture without end<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In utter darkness, and their portion set<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BEELZEBUB.  To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the horrid silence thus began.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00017">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the fierce contention brought along<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And courage never to submit or yield:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is else not to be overcome?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since through experience of this great event<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We may with more successful hope resolve<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00018">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00019">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here swallow'd up in endless misery.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By right of Warr, what e're his business be<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What can it then avail though yet we feel<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To undergo eternal punishment?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00020">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To do ought good never will be our task,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As being the contrary to his high will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom we resist.  If then his Providence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of good still to find means of evil;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But see the angry Victor hath recall'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;How overcome this dire Calamity,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If not what resolution from despare.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00021">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That with reiterated crimes he might<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil to others, and enrag'd might see<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On Man by him seduc't, but on himself<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And such appear'd in hue, as when the force<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave a singed bottom all involv'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00022">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is its own place, and in it self<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter where, if I be still the same,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I should be, all but less then hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' associates and copartners of our loss<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And call them not to share with us their part<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00023">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus answer'd.  Leader of those Armies bright,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;New courage and revive, though now they lye<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00024">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Under amazement of their hideous change.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If such astonishment as this can sieze<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;After the toyl of Battel to repose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' advantage, and descending tread us down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00025">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A multitude, like which the populous North<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;God their Creator, and th' invisible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And Devils to adore for Deities:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then were they known to men by various Names,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Abominations; and with cursed things<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His Temple right against the Temple of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Can execute their aerie purposes,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of despicable foes.  With these in troop<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In SION also not unsung, where stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To Idols foul.  THAMMUZ came next behind,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of alienated JUDAH.  Next came one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;He also against the house of God was bold:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had vanquisht.  After these appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather then human.  Nor did ISRAEL scape<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With lust and violence the house of God.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And injury and outrage: And when Night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the prime in order and in might;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the universal Host upsent<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To highth of noblest temper Hero's old<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing united force with fixed thought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Glories: For never since created man,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Could merit more then that small infantry<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By FONTARABBIA.  Thus far these beyond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;All her Original brightness, nor appear'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark'n'd so, yet shon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With singed top their stately growth though bare<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar'd<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br>
