Use this page to launch DIVMosaics demo in FF/Chrome, in order to have an identical (and comparable) window size with Servo.

Needed as FF/Chrome do not allow window resizing. Servo does however.
The index.html script performs the resizing.

var win = window.open('index.html', 'Experiment', 'target=_blank');
